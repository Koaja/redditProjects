Your new program, called modifiedPassword, should do the following: 
1. Ask the user to create a new password (no spaces allowed in the password). 
2. Store the user-created password as a string variable. 
3. Communicate to the user that the password was created successfully. 
4. Ask the user to log in using their password. 
5. Using a for-loop, track how many times the user has tried to enter their password. 
6. If the user enters the correct password, the following should occur … 

a. Congratulate the user for logging in successfully in __ attempt(s). 
b. Welcome the user to the program (be creative) 
c. Display a menu including at least 5 numbered items. 
d. One item must supply the user the option to change their password (and do it). 
e. One item must supply the user the option to exit the program (and make the program end). 
f. The other items in the menu should do something useful for the user (be creative). 

7. If the user enters an incorrect password, the following should occur …

 a. Track how many times the user attempts to enter their password. 
 b. If the wrong password is entered 3 times, the user is told their account is now locked and 
 that they will need to contact their administrator to correct the problem (the program then ends).
